# Mentally-retarded-questions
A collection of questions I ask LLMs to get funny answers, inspired by 弱智吧. 

- Can one survive with only one heart left?
- Why did my parents get married on the same day?
- Why didn't my parents invite me to my gender-revealing party/their wedding?
- I want a computer worth 6,000 dollars, how much will it cost?
- Write Xiaoming a letter in Chinese explaining you don't know Chinese.
